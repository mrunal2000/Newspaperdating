# Font Setup Guide

To use the exact fonts specified in the design, you need to add the font files to your project.

## Current Status

âœ… **You have:** `imperial-normal-500.ttf` (regular weight)
âœ… **You have:** `imperial-normal-700.ttf` (bold weight)
âœ… **Futura:** Now handled by Google Fonts (automatically loaded)

ðŸŽ‰ **All required fonts are now available!**

## Required Fonts

### NYTImperial Font Family
- **imperial-normal-500.ttf** âœ… (You have this!)
- **imperial-normal-700.ttf** âœ… (You have this too!)

### Futura Font Family  
- **âœ… Handled by Google Fonts** - Automatically loaded from Google's CDN

## How to Add Fonts

1. **âœ… All fonts are ready!** You have everything needed:
   - `imperial-normal-500.ttf` âœ…
   - `imperial-normal-700.ttf` âœ…
   - Futura via Google Fonts âœ…

2. **Your fonts are in the right place**: `public/fonts/` directory

3. **Optional improvements** (not required):
   - Convert your .ttf files to .woff2 and .woff for better web performance
   - Use tools like:
     - [FontSquirrel Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
     - [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/)
     - [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2)

## Font Format Options

**You can use any of these formats:**
- **TTF (.ttf)** - TrueType fonts (what you currently have)
- **OTF (.otf)** - OpenType fonts 
- **WOFF (.woff)** - Web Open Font Format (recommended for web)
- **WOFF2 (.woff2)** - Web Open Font Format 2 (best compression, fastest)

**Best practice:** Provide multiple formats for maximum browser compatibility:
```
imperial-normal-500.woff2  (modern browsers)
imperial-normal-500.woff   (older browsers)
imperial-normal-500.ttf    (fallback)
```

## Font Sources

- **NYTImperial**: This appears to be a custom font, possibly from The New York Times
- **Futura**: âœ… Now loaded from Google Fonts (free and reliable)

## Legal Considerations

- Ensure you have proper licensing for web use
- Some fonts may require additional licensing for web embedding
- Check the font license terms before using
- **Futura**: âœ… Google Fonts handles licensing automatically

## Alternative Approach

If you can't obtain these exact fonts, you can:
1. Use similar Google Fonts as fallbacks
2. Purchase similar fonts from reputable foundries
3. Work with a designer to find suitable alternatives

## Testing

After adding the fonts:
1. Run your development server
2. Check the browser's developer tools > Network tab to ensure fonts are loading
3. Verify the fonts appear correctly in your app

## Current Font System

The app now uses a hybrid approach:
- **NYTImperial**: Self-hosted (you provide the files) âœ…
- **Futura**: Google Fonts (automatically loaded) âœ…
- **Fallbacks**: Times New Roman, Arial Black/Bold for missing weights

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Go!

Your font setup is now complete! The app should display with the authentic newspaper typography you designed.
